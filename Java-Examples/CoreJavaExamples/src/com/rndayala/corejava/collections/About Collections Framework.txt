Collections Framework
----------------------

part of java.util package - which includes utility classes that mainly represent 
sophisticated data structures.

	These data structures are ready to use, highly efficient which we can use
	right out of the box without having to implement ourselves.
	
--> Supports basically "whole collection" of elements.

General requirements which need to be fulfilled by data structures for real world use-cases :

1. No knowledge about size.
2. Automatically extendable.
3. Fast random access.
4. Fast lookups.
5. Ordered vs Unordered
6. Duplicate vs Unique
7. null vs non-null
8. Automatic sorting
9. <key, value> mappings.
